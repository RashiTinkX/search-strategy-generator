"""
Deterministic canonicalization of concept blocks.

This is the layer that makes two DIFFERENT models (or two runs of one model)
collapse onto the same PubMed query whenever their proposals are *semantically*
the same. The evaluation showed within-model reproducibility was fine but
cross-model agreement was ~0.09 — every model produced a distinct query. The
divergence was mostly cosmetic or redundant, not substantive:

  1. block ORDER differed (AND is commutative, the string is not)
  2. redundant NARROWER headings ("Hippocampus" + "CA1 Region, Hippocampal" +
     "Dentate Gyrus"): `[MeSH Terms]` already auto-explodes, so a descendant of
     another heading in the same OR block adds nothing
  3. duplicate headings / unsorted heading lists
  4. FUZZY resolution let a hallucinated heading become a real (wrong) one:
     `_resolve_mesh` fell back to a substring LIKE match and auto-selected the
     first hit, so e.g. "CNS disease" resolved to the descriptor whose stored
     label happened to be the Dutch "Ziekte, centraalzenuwstelsel-" — a tag
     PubMed cannot match at all.

Everything here is a pure function of (proposal, MeSH index): no LLM, no clock,
no randomness. Blocks in, canonical blocks out.

Block shape (same as query_builder / /api/compile):
    {"name": str, "slot": str, "mesh": [heading, ...],
     "freetext": [term, ...], "explode": bool}
